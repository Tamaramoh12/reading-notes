**Growth Mindest:** can open pathways to more creativity and possibility, and enable the setting of higher goals and more achievement. 

so, to keep your self always in a growth mindset you should follow these tips:
- embrace your challenges rather than avoid it. 
- persist your obstacles, don't lose your focus.
- learn from criticisms, don't ignore it.
