## How to choose your text editor?

*Briefly,  It is a very personal choice, the best text editor is
truly the one that you enjoy using the most.*

### What Is A Text Editor?
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

### Is There A Difference Between "Text editor" and "Code editor"?
actually both are editors, and you can write the code either on text editor or code editor. but the code editor is better for  writing code, because of many reasons, such as:
- code completion
-syntax highlighting
- nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
- the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.

###### Example:
<html>
  <head>
    <title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
    </header>
    <main>
    </main>
    <footer>
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
  That is how it looks on code editors.
  But if  you write it on text editor it will looks like it.
  <html>
  <head>
  <title>
  </head>
  <body>
  <header>
  </header>
  <main>
  </main>
  <footer>
  </footer>
  </body>
  </html>
  


### What About Using The Software That Already Comes With Your Computer?
Every computer will come with its own text editor. On Mac computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called, “Text Edit.” On Windows computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called, “Notepad.” And on Linux computers, each distribution will have its own text editor already installed but which one might depend on the flavor of your particular distribution.
Usually, the text editors that come on your computer don’t have many features to speak of. They’re the barest bare bones text editors you’ll encounter.
While you certainly can use Notepad and Text Edit to make websites, there are other text editors available that might help you code more efficiently.
