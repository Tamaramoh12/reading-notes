### hello from the 2nd day of 102 code 
Today we learned more about **Git** and **Github** and we clearly know the differences between them.

so, would you like to know what I have known?

if **yes**, then follow this article :smile:

First of all you have to know that **Git** and **Github** are not the same !

Then, 

Git | Github
------------ | -------------
Local | Remote [cloud]]
Version control ability | Version control ability
can't make collaborate | Collaborate

as a begining I think it is enough to know, away from technical details.

Another time we will continue and dig in the details.

*Best wishes,*
