**What is a script and how do we creat it?**

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. 

**Writing a Script** 

- To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. 

- Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps. 

- Once you know the goal of your script, you can work out the individual tasks needed to achieve it.This high level view of tasks can be represented using a flowchart)

- Every step for every task shown in a flowchart needs to be written in a language the computer can understand and follow.
