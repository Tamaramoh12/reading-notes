# Introduction to Javascript.

## Scripts
**What is a script?**

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

**Writing a Script** 

- To write a script, you need to state your goal at first and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. 

- Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps. 

- Once you know the goal of your script, you can work out the individual tasks needed to achieve it.This high level view of tasks can be represented using a flowchart)

- Every step for every task shown in a flowchart needs to be written in a language the computer can understand and follow. 



## Excepressions
**What is expression?**

something that is evaluates into (results in) a single value.

**Excpression Types:**

- Excepressions that just assign a value to a variable. (Ex: var color = 'red';)
- Excepressions that use toor more values to return a single value. (Ex: var area = 20 * 30;)



## Operators
**What is operators?**
spmething that allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values, In addotion it is the thing that excepressins rely on.

**Operators Types:**

- Assignment operators. (Ex: color = 'beige';)
- Arithmetic operators.(Ex: area = 3 * 2;)
- String operators. (Ex: greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Molly';)
- Comparison operators. (Ex: buy = 3 > 5;)
- Logical operators. (buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);)

## Functions
**What is functions?**
something that let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 

**Decalring a function**
to create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces. as well as writing the function keyword at the begining.

Example:

function hello(){
  document.write("Helloworld");
}

after that you have to call the function using the follwing statement:
hello();
