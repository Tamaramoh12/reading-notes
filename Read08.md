# Comparison Operators.

We can use comparison operators to **evaluate conditions**, and the result will be **boolean** (True or False).

**Examples of comparison operators**

Operator | What it mean
------------ | -------------
== | equal to
!= | not equal to
=== | strict equal to 
!== | strict not equal to 
> | greater than 
< | less than
>= | greater than or equal to
<= | less than or equal to



# Logical Operators.

We can use logical operators to **compare th results of more than one comparison operator**

**Examples of logical operators:**

Operator | What it mean
------------ | -------------
&& | Logical and 
 || | Logical or
! | logical not



# Loops.
loops check a condition, and keep executes the statement inside the condition if the condition is **true**, whenever the condition becomes **false** the loop will stop.

**We have three types of loops, which is:**
1. FOR

for(var i = 0; i<10;i++){

console.log("statement");

}

2. WHILE


3. DO WHILE
